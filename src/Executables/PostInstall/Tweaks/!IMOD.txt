## XHCI Interrupt Moderation (IMOD)

On most systems, Windows 7 uses an IMOD interval of 1ms whereas recent versions of Windows use 0.05ms (50us) unless specified by the installed USB driver. This means that after an interrupt has been generated, the XHCI controller waits for the specified interval for more data to arrive before generating another interrupt which reduces CPU utilization but potentially results in data from a given device being supplied at an inconsistent rate in the event of expecting data from other devices within the waiting period that are connected to the same XHCI controller.

For example, a mouse with a 1kHz polling rate will report data every 1ms. While only moving the mouse with an IMOD interval of 1ms, interrupt moderation will not be taking place because interrupts are being generated at a rate less than or equal to the specified interval. Realistically while playing a fast-paced game, you will easily surpass 1000 interrupts/s with keyboard and audio interaction while moving the mouse hence there will be a loss of information because you will be expecting data within the waiting period from either devices. Although this is unlikely with an IMOD interval of 0.05ms (50us), it can still happen.

As an example, 1ms IMOD interval with an 8kHz mouse is already problematic because you are expecting data every 0.125ms which is significantly greater than the specified interval and of course, results in a major bottleneck ([1](https://www.overclock.net/threads/usb-polling-precision.1550666/page-61#post-28576466)).

- Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist may need to be disabled with the command below in order to load the [RWEverything](http://rweverything.com) driver however a handful of in-game anti-cheats do not adhere to disabling the blocklist (e.g. CS2, THE FINALS)

    reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CI\Config" /v "VulnerableDriverBlocklistEnable" /t REG_DWORD /d "0" /f

- In some cases, the interrupter index can change after a reboot meaning the address will become invalid if it is hard-coded. To work around this, you can simply disable IMOD for all interrupters by placing the [XHCI-IMOD-Interval.ps1](https://gist.github.com/amitxv/4fe34e139f0aec681a6122f39757d86e) script somewhere safe and launching it at startup. See [docs/startup-techniques.md](/docs/startup-techniques.md)

    ```
    PowerShell C:\XHCI-IMOD-Interval.ps1
    ```

- To determine whether changing the IMOD interval is taking effect, you can temporarily set the interval to ``0xFA00`` (62.5Hz). If the mouse cursor is visibly stuttering upon movement, then the changes are successfully taking effect
