This behavior is controlled by the kernel variable KiSerializeTimerExpiration, which is
initialized based on a registry setting whose value is different between a server and client
installation. By modifying or creating the value SerializeTimerExpiration
other than 0 or 1, serialization can be disabled, enabling timers to be distributed among
processors. Deleting the value, or keeping it as 0, allows the kernel to make the decision
based on Modern Standby availability, and setting it to 1 permanently enables serialization
even on non-Modern Standby systems.
